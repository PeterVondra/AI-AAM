-Invariant representation (IR)
	Consider using neural network for invariant representations, as in multiple hidden layers acting as abstractions
-Auto associative memory (AAM)
	Hopfield network (HAM)
	Bidirectional associative memory (BAM)
	Memory is stored in a hierarchy
-Predict based on memory (PDM)
	Neural networks are in general predictive, the memory network should have this integrated
-Time is also a factor in memory, just as sequences are

Proposition 1: 
INPUT -> IR -> AAM -> PDM -> OUTPUT

Proposition 2: 
MEMORY SYSTEM (Hierarchy)
INPUT -> IR -> BAM[0] ... BAM[n] -> OUTPUT

IR.NN.CORRECTION_DATA = AAM.OUTPUT

NN: Neural Network

IR -> BAM = NN -> BAM = NN -> BAM[0] -> ... -> BAM[n]
