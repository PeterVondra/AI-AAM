-Invariant representation IR
	Consider using neural network for invariant representations, as in multiple hidden layers acting as abstractions
-Auto associative memory AAM
	Find out more on how these are built
	Memory is stored in a hierarchy
-Predict based on memory PDM
	Neural networks are in general predictive, the memory network should have this integrated
-Time is also a factor in memory, just as sequences are
